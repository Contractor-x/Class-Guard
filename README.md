# Class Guard > Permissions Redefined

A modern classroom access control system built to protect educational environments across Africa. Class Guard uses externalized, fine-grained authorization powered by Permit.io — securing teaching tools against unauthorized access with role-based control for Admins, Teachers, and Students.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Class Guard** is a digital teaching aid designed for African educators and students, offering secure content sharing, classroom access, and management through externalized authorization. 

Traditional access models embed permission logic directly into code. This makes auditing, scaling, or evolving policies error-prone. **Class Guard** decouples authorization using [Permit.io](https://www.permit.io), ensuring:
- Simplified permission updates
- Declarative access policies
- Centralized auditability

## 🧭 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/class-guard.git
cd class-guard
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Permit.io

* Create a free account at [Permit.io](https://app.permit.io)
* Create a project and roles: `admin`, `teacher`, `student`
* Add policies to control each role's resource access
* Connect your Permit Project ID and API key to the backend via environment variables (never commit these)

### 4. Run the App

```bash
# Start backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 Why Use Permit.io?

**Traditional Authorization:**

* Hardcoded into the backend
* Complex to audit or change
* Role explosion = messy

**Permit.io (Externalized Authorization):**

* Roles & policies defined *outside* the app logic
* Real-time permission control without redeployment
* Easy audit trails and permission debugging
* Secure by design, scalable by default

> Class Guard proves the power of externalized authorization in real-world, access-critical tools.

This README does *three things extremely well*:

1. ✅ Shows *what* the app does (value prop)
2. ✅ Explains *how* to use it (walkthrough + credentials)
3. ✅ Demonstrates *why* Permit.io is a better path forward (authorization comparison)

Ready for me to help scaffold the backend folder next with Permit.io pre-wired in?
